This is a Mini project on Crop Recommendation System, which integrates a Random Forest machine learning algorithm along with Web - development tools.
Through this recommendation system we can predict what type of crop can be sown depending on the soil pH, temperature, nitrogen levels, potassium levels , etc.
The dataset is from kaggle (Crop Recommendation Dataset) : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset
